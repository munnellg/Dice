# Dice

Playing around with methods of simulating dice rolls in code. Method 
computes a gaussian distribution based on number of dice and values on faces
of the dice, then generates a random number under that distribution.

Repository contains my implementation of the Mersenne Twister PRNG. This is
included purely for fun, but is almost guaranteed to be buggy and biased.

Main generates a player class for Steve Jackson and Ian Livingston's Fighting 
Fantasy series in order to demonstrate use.
